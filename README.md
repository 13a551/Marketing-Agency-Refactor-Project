# Marketing-Agency-Refactor-Project

Hi there, I'm Tanveer - aka 13a551 ğŸ‘‹

This project is for a client that wanted their one page website refactored using semantic HTML/CSS and to condense their codebase to make it more accessible.

I'm a Coder, Son, Developer, and Student!!
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything ğŸ¤£
ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other content creators
ğŸ¥… 2022 Goals: Learn more about coding and become a full stack dev!
âš¡ Fun fact: I love to read and go to the gym
